# Digit_Recogniser
Doing handwritten digit recognition using using single layer artificial neural network.

The scripts were written in GNU Octave.

To run a live script, I would suggest to download an instance of GNU Octave(it's small) and run the "main.m" file at the Octave command line like shown here
## >> main
And now the live script will run.
