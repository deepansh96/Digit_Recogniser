# Digit_Recogniser
Doing handwritten digit recognition using using single layer artificial neural network trained on MNIST dataset.

The scripts were written in GNU Octave. (The code is compatible in Matlab but some scripts might not work)

To run a live script, I would suggest to download an instance of GNU Octave(it's small) and run the "main.m" file at the Octave command line like shown here
## >> main
And now the live script will run.
